\chapter{Conclusions}

A basic User interface has already been built, with the ability to retrieve useful information and allow users to create feature files with specific value. Users can choose which feature file they want to use to test the computational model, then the system will produce the result and the users can view it. Users can also customize the feature file by choosing their own value and parameter and test the model with their own feature file. In the future, it is planned to add more ways to display the result, allowing users to pick and choose what type of result display they want. Another plan is to add a more flexible feature file create system, allowing people to create feature files with more variety. Below is a detail the plan of work:\\*

Phase1: Understand how Causcumber work\\*

Phase2: Have a good idea on how Behave and Cucumber function in Causcumber\\*

Phase3: Design and implement user interface and focus on scrum to gather feedback and \space 

~~~~~~ ~ ~ adjust the system according to it\\*

Phase4: Polish the system and debug or add new function according to feedback if needed\\*

*This schedule is subject to change due to the uncertainty in various phase of the project\\*\\*
