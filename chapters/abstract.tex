\chapter*{\Large \center Abstract}

With the inventions of supercomputer with powerful processing power, a common way to
utilize it is to run complex computational models that can be used to predict the outcome
of a certain event. These modules often involve large number of inputs and outputs and can
be extremely time consuming to test. The goal of this project is to create a tool that can be
used to test these complex computational models, this tool needs to be easy to understand,
and accessible for people who have limited software testing experience. Parts of the tool for
this project has already been in development, but it still requires some functions to make the
system user-friendly. A simple user interface with the ability to display results and create new
test sets have been implanted, the results show that this system is capable of assisting non-software engineer users access this system without too much trouble.
