\chapter*{\Large \center Abstract}

With the inventions of supercomputer with powerful processing power, a common way to utilize it is to run complex computational models that can be used to analysis the behaviour or outcome of a certain event. These modules often involve large number of inputs and outputs and can be extremely time consuming to test. A tool name Causcumber that can be uses to execute the test has already been in development, but it still requires some functions to make the system user-friendly. The goal of this project is to allow users who donâ€™t have extend knowledge in software testing to be able to use the Causcumber system. This tool needs to be easy to understand, and accessible for people.
A tool with the ability to display results and create new
test sets have been created, this streamed line the testing process, minimize the need for users to interact with the coding part of the testing.
