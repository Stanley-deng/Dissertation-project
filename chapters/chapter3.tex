\chapter{Analysis}
Computational models are often too large and complex when testing with traditional methods, this often causes developers of those models unwilling to test their models thoroughly[MODELS NOT TESTED RIGHT REFERENCE]. Furthermore, computational model developers are often scientists or researchers that don’t have extensive knowledge in software testing. Causal model testing combines with Behave can be a powerful tool to test computational model, but even with this method there’s still require tester to learn a certain syntax. It may still be difficult to encourage people who don’t have software engineering background to participate in testing. \\*\\*
To encourage more people to participate in testing, a way to simplify the process is needed. By reduce the need for tester to program and assist the process in creating test case, this can encourage people to test models with this tool.

\section{Project Requirements}
The goal of this project is to develop a tool that simplify the testing process of using Causcumber, a tool that help testers who aren’t trained in software to test a computational model. This tool should be able to assist tester in the process by reduce the need for tester interact with the coding part of testing directly. After that, this tool should be able to execute the feature file they have written, the system will examine the feature file and go through the computational model to check if the model performs as the test specifies. As a result, the system should produce a coherent result detailing the accuracy of the tested model. Thus, the systems need to accomplish the following:\\*
\\*
R1. As a user, I want this system to be easy to understand, when I use the system, I want to immediate know what I need to do to get the result I want.\\*
\\*
R2.As a user, I want to use the system to aid my testing process by reducing the need to code directly. \\*
\\*
R3. As a user, I want the system to go through the feature file I created and test the computational model with it.\\*
\\*
R4. As a user, I want the system to produce a result where I can know the accuracy of the computational model.\\*
\\*
Since Causcumber has been in development for a while, what this project aims to accomplish is adding more to this tool. Currently the state of Causcumber is capable of executing feature files to test models. And it is capable of returning a lot of useful information, but the information still requires some organization to make the result easier to read, also there isn’t a way to execute the testing system without using the terminal to execute the command. It also required testers to manually code every part of the test such as the DOT file that define the relation of the parameter, or the feature file that define the value and expected result. This makes testing with Causcumber still fairly complex, so there’s a need for a tool to assist people in operating the system. \\*\\*
To simplify and streamline the testing process, this tool should reduce the need for testers to interact with the code directly. Therefore, this tool for Causcumber should be able to accomplish the following:\\*
\\*
1. As a user, I want the result produced by the system to be clean and easy to understand, focusing on the important part.\\*
\\*
2. As a user, I want to have the ability to change to different scenarios, so I can test models under different settings.\\*
\\*
3. As a user, I want to have the ability to create new scenarios with essential files, so I can modify these files to test the model.\\*
\\*
4. As a user, I want to execute and interact with the system through a user interface.\\*
\\*
5. As a user, I want to have a more convenient way to create a feature file, to avoid any mistake during the creation of the feature file.\\*
\\*
6. As a user, I want to have a more simplify way to create a Dot file, to make the creating process less confusing. \\*

\section{Requirement analysis}
The main theme for this project is simplify and ease of use, and therefore that’s what most of the requirements are focused on. For requirement R 1 – 4, the goal is to make the testing process as simple as possible, with a simplified testing process, people will be more willing to test their computational model with this tool. \\*\\*
To enhance the user experience for Causcumber, requirement 1, 2, 3 are aimed to achieve this. These requirements make using Causcumber to test computational models a more convenient experience. \\*\\
Since integrating the causal model testing can be difficult and confusing, requirements 4, 5, 6 are focused on simplifying this process, by making testing with Causcumber less code demanded, this should help mitigate a lot of errors and further simplify the testing process.
